#function explanation: takes in a string and replaces a certain character within the string.
#This function mimics how languages such as C can do arithmetic on specific characters rather
#than raku's default square bracket notation behaviour of treating one element as an entire string.
#In raku, even if you inserted commas between every character in the string, raku still cannot
#increment it so therefore this function was necessary. Below the code, are 2 small examples of
#how it can be used, it can also be used in other ways such as in a loop.

sub replace($s, $i, &y) is export
{
return substr($s, 0, $i) ~ y(comb($s, $i)) ~ substr($s, $i + 1);
};

#my $strng = "pass";
#$strng = replace($strng, 3, {'t'});
#print($strng);
#to temporerily change $strng do
#print(replace($strng, 3, {'t'}););
