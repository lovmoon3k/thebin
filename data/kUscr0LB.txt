Homewrecker
+ Added 20% damage resistance from ranged sources while active
+ Added 50% knockback resistance while active
- Added 50% damage penalty vs sappers
- Added 100% slower holster penalty
Intent on giving the item a better identity than purely used for babysitting engineers, being used to protect pyro from chip damage while moving or when rushing unguarded buildings.

Neon Annihilator
+ Added: The first hit causes an electric burst for extra damage
~ Burst deals 80 extra blast damage in a radius of 110 Hu
~ Recharges in 40 seconds
- Added 50% slower deploy speed
- Removed damage applied to sappers
Another sapper destroying weapon was definitely not needed, so rather than screwing spies over, this version provides Pyro with a caber-like item for a last resort melee, and synergizes with the gas to provide a stronger burst to a group akin to a caber-knight crit.

Flamethrowers
+ Fixed problems with flames not applying
- Reduced time for flames to linger to 2 seconds
Frequency of flames was seen as inconsistent, and potentially lasted too long, so flame application was tweaked.

Huo-Long Heater
+ Removed DRAGON meter as requirement to cause explosive kills
- Weapon only causes explosive kills while ring is active
Tying the effect to a meter ultimately seemed too niche. This version makes the ring of fire provide both a ranged and personal source of afterburn to justify the extra cost of ammo consumption to worsen your sustainability.

Iron Curtain
- Meme? GONE.
It's time to stop.
