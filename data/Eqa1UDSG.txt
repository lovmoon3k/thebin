# WEBINAR: For Loops

# We use loops to repeat actions

# a WHILE loop... btw.. is basically an IF statement
# that repeats as long as its condition is true

# FOR LOOPS are used for repeating actions for every element
# in a container like a list, string, tuple, etc...

# Basic syntax of a for loop
# for __someVar__ in __someContainer__:

# list
myList = ["Agent Scully", "Agent Mulder", "Walter Skinner", "CSM", "Mr. X"]
for item in myList:
    print(item) # print(item, end="\n")

# tuples
myTuple = ("Gilligan", "Castaway002", "red", "crew")
for item in myTuple:
    print(item)

# strings
myString = "It was the best of times."
for char in myString:
    print(char)

# printing on the same line... overriding the end parameter of print()
for char in myString:
    print(char, end="-")
print() # get the new line back
# print("I want this on a new line.") # good way to check yourself

# dictionaries
# myDict = {"key": "value"}

}
# myDict[key] # retrieve the value associated with that key
# myDict[key] = value # assign a value to that key
for key in bestOfXF:

    # val = bestOfXF[key]
