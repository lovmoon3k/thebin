Will AI replace copywriters?

This is a question that comes up a lot, and yes, we do believe that AI will eventually replace some of the tasks that copywriters do, but it will NOT replace copywriters. There are many things that copywriters do that are difficult for AI to replicate. For example, writing unique content for each user requires a human touch; this is something machines will have difficulty with for some time to come. Other things that require human intelligence include creating compelling headlines and writing compelling product descriptions. But we are excited about the possibilities of what this technology could bring to our industry!
