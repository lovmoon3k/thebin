<h1>Excluded Titles</h1>
<p>
I excluded Four Swords and Minish Cap since you can't get those unless if you time travel back in time a few years (or Nintendo releases them again). I excluded console exclusive titles such as Twilight Princess to focus only on what is playable on 3DS without hacking. I also excluded the DS games based on Tingle; they're rare and aren't exactly Zelda-like barring dungeons and the titular Tingle (and there's one that's just a Balloon Fight clone so there's that too)
