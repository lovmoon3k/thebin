<h1>About</h1>
<br><br>Siren is a catgril who grew up learning different things about magic and the world around her. she was trained to be a well-rounded mage. Despite her supernatural abilities, Siren likes to live a rather simple and easy life. <br><br>
Siren sometimes poses for magazines on her off times, or performs music; knowing a huge range of instruments. She loves to perform for people, and gets a rush out of a crowd watching her. <br><br>
Siren is really forward when it comes to greeting people. though that's also due to her species. anyone she finds attractive she'll throw herself onto them. Or, they'll end up falling for her.<br><br>
