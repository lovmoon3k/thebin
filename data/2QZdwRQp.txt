# Script by: Peter Lunk 

"""
This MicroPython script is for Raspberry Pi Pico W (Wifi) device
that connects to a Wi-Fi network and synchronizes its time with 
a NTP (Network Time Protocol) server. 
The script first sets up a connection to the Wi-Fi network using
the specified ssid (network name) and password, and then sets
the device's time using the ntptime.settime() function. 
The device continuously retrieves the current time from internal
clock and displays it along with the current date and day of the
year on the serial monitor every second.
The script synchronizes the time with NTP every day at midnight.
