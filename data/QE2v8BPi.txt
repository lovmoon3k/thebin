Syringe Guns
- Reduced amount each syringe reduces crit heals to 3 seconds at base
Feedback stated it appeared to do it's job too quickly. This change equates to about +1 more syringe to get to max healing, which shouldn't slow things down too much.

Huo-Long Heater
+ Reduced damage requirement for DRAGON meter to 300
+ Increased time before drain to 5 seconds, drain time to 10 seconds
Feedback showed that the window of opportunity to use the new mechanic was far too short. This should make it last longer and allow the Heavy to actually gain momentum in fights with this.

Conniver's Kunai
~ Health gained changes based on your current health:
+ When at/below 100% HP: steal 67% of backstab target's health
- When above 100% HP: steal 33% of backstab target's health
Based on feedback and *plenty* of discussion, this change was decided on should allow the spy to still gain a big buff on first stab but allow it to more quickly falloff on repeat stabs, and forcing the spy to be more considerate on picking targets.

Tomislav
- Increased firing speed penalty to 25% slower
Additionally discussed, and based on a bug due to the actual firing speed differing based on server ticks. This ought to keep the weapon still good in a more aggressive style and at mid-range, while falling off properly in more prolonged fights and close range compared to stock.
