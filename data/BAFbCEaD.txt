           You can put a neat introduction here. It's preferable if you include something, though, about them. A warning. A rumor. Whispers of horror. A story. As long as it takes up this space, go hog wild. Just keep in mind it does scroll along with whatever you include in the tabs on the side. Oh, if you click multiple boxes open, they'll in the order of the squares.

  the background story for the character before the story. what was life like before the events of the story? you can talk about their childhood here if it's applicable. what about any notable events, accidents, moments? you don't have to be so detailed - they're your character and you can go all out if you want.
  <p>  </p><p></p>
  personally, i like doing the before story and after story in case it wasn't clear enough in the story. once again, include any notable events, accidents, moments, death, children in the future, accomplishments, etc? there's so much to consider. but if you don't want to do that, that's totally fine too. include what you want in your character's background.
