## Install Mod Organizer 2 with Skyrim SE/AE on Steam Deck:
# to understand how all this works, be sure to check out my video on youtube:
# https://youtu.be/dPguPMbAJEc

# be sure to update the paths and locations according to your own situation, this is just a template.
# commands that should be run from the terminal will be prefixed with # -- command:
# Files you should create will have # --- /path/to/file/location
# all files and commands should be created/run as the normal (deck) user, none of these tasks require root access.


# -- Command: start installation
# remember to update for the location of the installer you downloaded!
