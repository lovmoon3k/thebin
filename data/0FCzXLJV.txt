Explanation:

    The code uses the LiquidCrystal library to interface with an LCD display, so the LCD is connected to digital pins 12, 11, 5, 4, 3 and 2.
    The button is connected to digital pin 8 and the LED to digital pin 7.
    The button is used to start the timer and to enter the time in minutes.
    The LED will turn on
