Secure cloud data backup and more
Founded by Morten Westerberg, who has dual US and Danish citizenship, in 2003, Nordic Backup was one of the first companies with a vision for cloud backup. For nearly two decades and thousands of companies and individuals protected, Nordic Backup has never a lost a single byte of customer data. Weâ€™ve restored thousands of computers and millions of files, getting businesses back up and running and lives back to normal.
More than anything else, we believe that says who we are.
