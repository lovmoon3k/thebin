// There is a problem though. Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins.
// If someone tries to insert some other coins, you have to display "Cannot accept {money}",
// where the value is formatted to the second digit after the decimal point and not add it to the total money.
// On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase. Your machine has, however,
// only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke". The prices are: 2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively.
// If the person tries to purchase a not existing product, print "Invalid product".
// Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product for which he doesn't have money.
// In that case, print "Sorry, not enough money".
// If the person purchases a product successfully print "Purchased {product name}".
// After the "End" command, print the money that is left formatted to the second decimal point in the format "Change: {money left}".
