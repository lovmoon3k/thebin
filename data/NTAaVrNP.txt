#Some (misguided people?) suggested 2 covid infections a year might not be so bad.
#So let's have the mean time to infection half a year.

#The mean of a binomial distribution is N*p, let N be days. So over a year
#N*p=2 -> p=2/365 (the probability of infection per day), To=2 day
#Therefore

#Not that in matlab/octave log(x) is the natural log of f
