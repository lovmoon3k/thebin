NodeJS is not only a programming language but a runtime environment that offers several benefits.

Highly extensible: NodeJS is highly extensible and offers users the ability to customize and add whatever they need over time. It helps prevent unnecessary libraries from being installed.

Scalability: Designed as a scalable network application, NodeJS handles many concurrent requests without straining the server. Once the tasks are completed NodeJS goes to sleep and avoids unnecessary usage of RAM.
Clean and consistent: Using NodeJS is considered more clear and more consistent because it is easy to send or synchronize the data between the server and client using the same language on both sides.
Several popular companies like Netflix, PayPal, NASA, and others use NodeJS to grab new opportunities and technology.
