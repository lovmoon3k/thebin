After watching some netflix documentaries about gaming I found out that Korea was ahead in gaming from the rest of the world. They were playing a lot of games!  So, I guess in tech they would be also ahead from the rest of the world.

As of the game entries. The most anticipated sequel of the start of 2023 is almost ready! I run into some problems with graphics handling in Lantern and then I run into the 48k memory barrier problem so the release date changed. 
"Firelord Quality Department" decided to follow the "Carpet" development model* so this problems are considered solved. Some minor presentation stuff must be fixed/created and it will be ready for release!
I know the whole world was shocked when they found out that COOKIE was based on a true story and the Cookie Man prehistoric cave actually exists! B


Also, I'm using a different approach than TMD2003. I aim to find unsuccesful games that were poorly implemented and give them the attention they need .I also have the courage to reveal the true stories behind them. 
I know the whole world was shocked when they found out that COOKIE was based on a true story! The true events that were described in the "Adventures Of Cookie" were hidden in the original game in an attempt to keep the world missinformed! Even D. Trump mentioned the conspiracy behind this in his facebook account** but he was banned from facebook and twitter! 



*Carpet Development Model or C.D.T. is a much used technique from many big companies. The idea is that if you have a problem you can always "hide it under the carpet". The carpet could be anything eg a big complex menu, an option that is activated if you have a different computer configuration than that you use etc...
