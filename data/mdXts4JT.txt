You guys act like im some evil villain, but your also the ones who wanted me to prevent issues like what has happened in the past, yet when i try to stop those issues i get punished for it. You say you want to keep things secret, but you guys openly talk about the exact things you didn't want us to talk about and i try to tell you guys to not say those things till we get it dealt with, im punished. Even though i was told that issues such as abuse of power wouldn't happen again, yet here we are. you act like im your enemy, even though your the ones who start the issues that i have to deal with. you guys always go for each others throats for the smallest of things, and when we call you out of it, you dont have responsibility. no you just try to excuse yourself by saying that someone in the past wronged you, yeah they did. yet we got hid of them and we all hated him what what he said, yet somehow we get punished for it anyways and are made out to be horrible people. we invited you back to try to mend bridges, yet all you have done recently is cause issues with bullying others. yet if anyone says what your doing is wrong, then were just like the dude who treated you wrong, or you say "your just like everyone else" or some stupid thing like that. so are you saying that "everyone else" are people that are just tired of your bullying? though if i bring up any of these issues to you, youll just punish me, and if i just talk anywhere youll peak your head out to make fun of me, yet somehow thats ok to everyone else because someone in the past wronged you. Shall i even start about when i tried to vent about how it feels like we have to walk on egg shells around you guys. one of you guys said the stupid line of "Have you considered that the problem is with you?" like others are agreeing about how it hurts to see this happening.
