Eyelander
- Increased shield recharge penalty to 25% slower
Bringing the recharge penalty to a slightly more impactful threshold for the bonus at max heads without being too crippling before kill.

Diamondback
+ Increased minicrits on stab to 5 seconds long
- No longer gains minicrits from sapped buildings
Rewarding crits for sapper destructions felt too random for both players in the interaction, so it was felt that simply keeping to backstabs was fairer. A slight buff to the duration should help to make the less 

Huo-Long Heater
+ Removed drain from DRAGON Meter from not doing damage or when enemy is killed at 100%
~ Changed DRAGON meter's function
+ Press SPECIAL ATTACK while revved up to activate meter, draining from full in 8 seconds
+ While meter is active, enemies killed will explode into a firework
- Activating meter forces the ring of fire on
- Increased damage to charge meter to 400
This version of the Heater's Meter intends to put more control in the player's hands when they want to chain ignition off of enemies, rather than needing to play around the meter automatically triggering or draining based on factors out of the Heavy's control.

Flamethrowers (experimental)
+ Flames will linger on surfaces for up to 3 seconds, dealing half the damage from normal contact with flames
This is an experiment to try to improve Pyro's base role without just making W+M1 more effective with higher DPS. Rather it focuses on the easy to apply damage providing area denial, this change attempting to extend how much area a pyro can cover with his flames.

CTF (experimental)
+ Intel resets four times faster when a teammate touches it
- Crits on capture disabled
Crits on capture made it snowball a little too strongly. Making intel reset faster is an attempt to make back-capping less powerful at bringing CTF to a statemate and allow an attacking team more leniency when defending their intel.
